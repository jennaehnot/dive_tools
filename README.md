# dive-tools
This repository is for converting object annotation files generated by the softwave [DIVE/VIAME toolkit](https://kitware.github.io/dive/) into YOLOv5 annotation files.


After annotating, their platform offers two methods for downloading:
1. annotations.dive.json
2. annotations.viame.csv
   
The annotation format for boundary boxes in VIAME/DIVE is x<sub>1</sub>, y~1~, x~2~, y~2~, describing the upper left and bottom right corners.
YOLOv5 boundary box format follows center~x~, center~y~, width~bb_box~, height~bb_box~, all normalized by the width and height of the photo.
