# dive-tools
This repository is for converting object annotation files generated by the softwave [DIVE/VIAME toolkit](https://kitware.github.io/dive/) into YOLOv5 annotation files.


After annotating, their platform offers two methods for downloading:
1. annotations.dive.json
2. annotations.viame.csv
   
The annotation format for boundary boxes in VIAME/DIVE is x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, <sub>2</sub>, describing the upper left and bottom right corners.
YOLOv5 boundary box format follows center<sub>x</sub>, center<sub>y</sub>, width<sub>bb_box</sub>, height<sub>bb_box</sub>, all normalized by the width and height of the photo.
